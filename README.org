** Installing the tools
   You'll need Ruby 2.3.1 installed. If you don't, I recommend
   installing [[https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv][rbenv]] and [[https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build][ruby-build]] (follow their installation
   instructions).

   After that, install the correct version with

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     rbenv install 2.3.1
   #+END_SRC

   The project is setup to use this version locally, so you don't need
   to explicitly set it as the global one (that's what the
   ~.ruby-version~ file is for).

   Now, every step from now on must be done in the directory of the
   project.

   Install bundler and execute bundle install

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     gem install bundler
     bundle install
   #+END_SRC
** Running the project
   You'll need first to execute the database migrations

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     bin/rails db:migrate
   #+END_SRC

   Then you can run the system!

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     bin/rails s
   #+END_SRC

   It will be available under ~http://localhost:3000/~.
